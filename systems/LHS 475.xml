			<description>LHS 475 b is the first planet that has been confirmed by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The planet is relatively close, at only 41 light-years away, in the constellation Octans. LHS 475 b is almost exactly the size of the Earth and is most likely a rocky planet. It completes an orbit in only 2 days and is much closer to its host star than any planet in our solar system. However, because the host star is a red dwarf star with a temperature half that of the Sun, researchers project it still could have an atmosphere. Among all operating telescopes, only Webb is capable of characterizing the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. Although researchers can't conclude what is present, they can definitely say what is not present. For example, the JWST data shows that LHS 475 b can't have a thick methane-dominated atmosphere, similar to that of Saturn's moon Titan.</description>
