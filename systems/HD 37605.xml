			<description>The planetary system HD 37605 hosts at least two planets. The inner planet is on a 55 day orbit with a very high eccentricity of 0.6767. This planet was discovered in 2004. In 2012, another planet on a 2720 day orbit was announced. In contrast to the inner planet, HD 37605 c is on an almost circular orbit. This leads to interesting speculations on the origin of the planetary system.</description>
