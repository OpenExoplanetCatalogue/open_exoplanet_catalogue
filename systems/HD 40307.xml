			<description>The HD 40307 system hosts at least 5 planets. A signal of a sixth planet has also been reported but should be taken with a grain of salt as it might correlate with chromospheric emission from the star. If the signal is a genuine signal of planetary origin, then this super-Earth might be habitable as it could support liquid water on its surface.</description>
