This script picks up the magnitudes and the spectral type from Simbad website.
*How to use it: 
    ***In variable "path", put the path of the repo where you have the XMLs.
    ***Run the script

*Structure:
    ***HTMLparser class to extract information from a webpage.
    ***Two main functions : magnitude : pick up magnitudes from Simbad
                            spectralType : pick up spectral type from Simbad, it is currently commented because I don't need to run it at the moment.
    ***A list generator function : create a file containing the name of the XML files in "path".
    
*Logs:
    ***Log_planet.txt has all files for which there was a 404 error. This file is not reset
    when the script is rerun. It works for both functions.
    
*Troubleshooting:                                    
    ***If Simbad don't recognize this name, either you search manually or you create a list with the
    other names for a system (Kepler, 2MASS...) and you rename the file with this name to let the script
    writing in it.

*Improvements:
    ***You can improve this script by a multi-name recognition :for a system, if there is a 404 error on simbad web page
    the script can try another name picked up in the XMLs and try it.
    This would avoid to make a manual reasearch or rename the files, recreate a list and rerun the script.

    ***There can be a problem with binaries system. Simbad always has only SP (spectral type) and mag for one star (don't know which)
    or the whole system but if this information exists for each star of a binary system, this script doesn't deal with it.
    
    ***Adapt it for other kind of extraction or for other website.
