	<description>Gliese 876 is a red dwarf only 15 light years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. The orbits of the outer three planets are locked in a Laplace reasonance. This resonance is also present in the moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede. This strong dynamical interaction leads to interesting conclusions about the formation history of the system. It is a very strong indication that the planets migrated in the protoplanetary disk to their current position and got locked into mean motion resonances during that process.</description>
